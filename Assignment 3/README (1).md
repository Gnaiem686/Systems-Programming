# 📘 Operating Systems – Assignments 1–3
This repository contains my solutions for the Operating Systems course assignments.  
The assignments implement core OS concepts such as process management, scheduling, synchronization, and memory management.

## 📚 Course Topics (Syllabus Overview)

### **2. Process & Thread Management**
- Process lifecycle, states, and data structures  
- OS-level support for processes and threads  
- Signals and their implementation in major operating systems  
- Basic scheduling concepts  
- Context switching and concurrency foundations  

### **3. Process / Thread Scheduling**
- Scheduling goals and quality criteria  
- CPU scheduling algorithms (FCFS, RR, SJF, Priority, Multilevel Queue, etc.)  
- Real-world scheduling implementations in modern operating systems  
- Performance, fairness, and throughput considerations  

### **4. Synchronization**
- The mutual-exclusion problem: definition and classical algorithms  
- Synchronization primitives based on reads/writes and atomic operations  
- General semaphores  
- Classic problems:  
  - Producer–Consumer  
  - Readers–Writers  
  - Dining Philosophers  
  - Bounded Buffer  
- Design and implementation of thread-safe concurrent systems  

### **5. Memory Management**
- Address spaces and basic memory concepts  
- Swapping & paging-based virtual memory  
- Multi-level page tables  
- Translation Lookaside Buffer (TLB)  
- Inverted page tables  
- Page replacement algorithms (LRU, FIFO, Optimal, Clock, etc.)  
- Real OS implementations of virtual memory

- POSIX threads (pthreads)  
- System calls  
- Linux utilities  
- Scheduling simulators  
- Synchronization primitives (mutexes, semaphores)  

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository demonstrates:
- Strong understanding of OS internals  
- Ability to implement concurrent programs
