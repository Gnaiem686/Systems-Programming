# 🖥️ Runtime Environments – Course Assignments & Projects

This repository contains all programming assignments and materials completed as part of the **Runtime Environments** course.  
The course teaches how programs interact with **runtime environments (RTEs)** and how to use RTE features effectively in real systems.

The emphasis is *not* on implementing OS internals, but on **using** the capabilities provided by systems such as Unix, the Java Virtual Machine, and modern programming languages.

## 📚 Course Topics (Syllabus Overview)

### **1. What Are Runtime Environments (RTEs)?**
- Understanding execution contexts  
- Examples: **Unix OS**, **Java Virtual Machine (JVM)**, scripting shells  
- Capabilities and limitations exposed to programmers  
- Choosing the right tools and abstractions for each environment  

## **2. Concurrency in Multithreaded/Multiprocess Environments**
- Threads vs. processes  
- Thread creation and management  
- Parallel execution models  
- Race conditions & synchronization primitives  
- Using concurrency to improve performance  
- Concurrency from Java (high-level) → to C++ & Unix threads (low-level)  

## **3. Memory Management**
- Memory as viewed by programming languages  
- Stack model vs. heap model  
- Pointers, ownership, references  
- Copying, cloning, garbage collection (Java) vs. manual memory management (C++)  
- Understanding allocation behavior in different RTEs  

## **4. Object-Oriented Design**
- Principles of OO design in modern runtimes  
- Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism  
- Designing reusable components  
- How RTEs expose OO abstractions  
- Java → C++ conceptual mapping  

## **5. C++ Programming**
- Using C++ to access low-level RTE interfaces  
- RAII, classes, references, smart pointers  
- Interfacing with Unix via system calls  
- C++ build tools: Makefiles, compilers, debugging tools  

## **6. Interprocess Communication (IPC)**
- Communicating across processes and machines  
- **Network sockets** (TCP/UDP)  
- Messaging patterns  
- Synchronous vs. asynchronous communication  
- High-level Java networking → low-level POSIX sockets  

## **7. Data Storage**
- Working with **files**, **directories**, file descriptors  
- Databases and **SQL** fundamentals  
- Object serialization and persistence  
- Binary vs. text-based formats  
- Data storage trade-offs and performance  

## **8. Programming Tools & Development Workflows**
- **Makefile** for building C/C++ projects  
- **Maven** for managing Java projects  
- **JUnit** for unit testing  
- Debuggers (gdb, Java debuggers)  
- Shell scripts for automation  

## 🧪 Practical Work
The course includes **3–4 full-scale programming assignments**, combining:

- Java (high-level RTE concepts)  
- C++ (low-level RTE mechanisms)  
- Unix system calls  
- Network programming  
- File I/O and persistence  
- Multithreading and concurrency  

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- **Java** (JVM, concurrency, networking, serialization)  
- **C++** (system-level RTE interfaces)  
- **Unix/Linux system calls**  
- **POSIX threads**  
- **Sockets (TCP/UDP)**  
- **SQL / Databases**  
- **Makefile, Maven, JUnit**  
- Shell scripting  

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
By completing this course, I developed the ability to:

- Understand how programs interact with runtime environments  
- Use concurrency effectively in both Java and C++  
- Manage memory using stack/heap models and object lifecycles  
- Design object-oriented applications suitable for multiple RTEs  
- Build networked applications using sockets  
- Store and serialize data across different systems  
- Debug, profile, and structure code using professional tools
